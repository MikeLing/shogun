Shogun can be built (optionally) with GPL codes enabled.
In order to allow for a less restrictive BSD compatible distribution of the
main repository, these have been moved to a separate repository, shogun-gpl.
The build automatically integrates these codes if it is checked out.
Please refer to the submodule for exact licensing text and code details.
